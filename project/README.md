# Project Overview

The project aims to predict the average daily rate (adr) for resort hotels based on booking information. The data set is a modified version from Hotel booking demand in Kaggle.1 The data set contains information like time and length of the stay, meal type and number of special requests. We will fit two linear regression models and one random forest model to make the predictions.
